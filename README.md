# 🔧 Verilog Practice Repository

This repository contains my **Verilog HDL practice files and projects**, created while learning and experimenting with **digital system design**.  
It includes basic modules, testbenches, and gradually builds up to more complex designs.

## 🛠 What’s Inside
- ✅ Combinational circuits (adders, multiplexers, decoders, encoders)  
- ✅ Sequential circuits (flip-flops, counters, shift registers)  
- ✅ Memory elements (RAM, ROM, register files)  
- ✅ Processor components (ALU, control unit, instruction decoder)  
- ✅ Testbenches for simulation and verification

## 🚀 Why This Repo?
I use this repository to:
- Practice **Verilog coding style** and HDL concepts  
- Strengthen my **FPGA/ASIC design skills**  
- Prepare for advanced projects like **RISC-V processors** and **digital systems**

## 📂 Structure
Each file/folder corresponds to a **specific concept** or **design module**, often accompanied by a **testbench**.
